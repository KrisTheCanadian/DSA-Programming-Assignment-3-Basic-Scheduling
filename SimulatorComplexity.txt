Time Complexity:

ArrayHeap Implementation:
Big-O:O(n) - Caused by Building the Heap
Big-Ω:Ω(log2(n)) - Caused by Heapify Algorithm and insert for min heap

SortedList Implementation:
Big-O:O(n) - Inserting an element in a sorted array to shift all elements.
Big-Ω:Ω(n) - Caused by Insertion to array

Space Complexity:

ArrayHeap Implementation:
Big-O:O(n) - Array being used as Heap is of size n.
Big-Ω:Ω(n) - Array being used as Heap is of size n.

SortedList Implementation:
Big-O:O(n) - Array being used for an ArrayList is of size n.
Big-Ω:Ω(n) - Array being used for an ArrayList is of size n.

Difference Between Each Implementations:
Looking at the results between the ArrayHeap and the SortedList, the ArrayHeap finished 100k jobs in 7379ms and the SortedList finished in 50548ms. 
This indicates that the ArrayHeap is 585% faster than the SortedList implementation for 100k jobs!
